"A poet of death, Antonio Machado spent hour after hour meditating upon, perceiving, and preparing for death; I have never known anyone else who so balanced these levels, equal in height or depth, as he did, and who by his living-dying overcame the gap between these existences, paradoxically opposed yet the only ones known to us; existences strongly united even though we others persist in separating, contrasting, and pitting them against each other.

All our life is usually given over to fearing death and keeping it away from us, or rather, keeping ourselves away from it.  Antonio Machado apprehended it in itself, yielded to it in large measure.  Possibly, more than a man who was born, he was a man reborn."
