### Antonio the good

"Spain in the twentieth century was a nation of extraordinary poets, each distinctive and original.  The most beloved of those poets, then and now, is Antonio Machado.  He is the quietest, the least pretentious, the most subtle and amusing in aphoristic skepticism, the deepest in the spirit's labyrinths, the freshest in voice, and the plainest in clear, landscape vision.

The poet read and loved philosophy.  But he iterated many times that logic doesn't sing.  Machado sings in all his poems."

### Soria and the hills of blue Ash

"By 1907, Machado wanted a regular job and became a schoolmaster in Soria, in a public school where he taught French.  His life's profession was the lowly school teacher in rural institutes (in the poem "Rural Meditation", he called himself "this humble teacher / in a country school")  There in Soria he met Leonor when she was thirteen and married her two years later, July 30, 1909; he was almost thirty-four.  In 1910 Antonio obtained a fellowship to study in France, and the couple went happily to Paris.  In July 1911, Leonor revealed strong symptoms of tuberculosis.  On their return to Castilla la Nueva in September, he nursed her as her health failed.  She was only eighteen in 1912 when she died.

In 1962 in Soria, I spoke at length to an old gentleman who fifty three years earlier had been at their wedding and who described how Antonio used to push Leonor in a wheelchair up into the hills during her last summer.  Machado remembers these hills in a series of poems of self-deceptive memory and depressing awakening:

```
Leonor, do you see the river poplars
with their firm branches ?
Look at the Moncayo blue and white.
Give me your hand and let us stroll.
Through these fields of my countryside,
embroidered with dusty olive groves,
I go walking alone,
sad, tired, pensive, old.
```

Although after Leonor's death Machado immediately requested and obtained a new post and so left Soria forever, the obsessive memory and conscious daydream of Leonor and Castilla stayed with him throughout his life."
