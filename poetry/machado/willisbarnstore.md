### Antonio the good

Spain in the twentieth century was a nation of extraordinary poets, each distinctive and original.  The most beloved of those poets, then and now, is Antonio Machado.  He is the quietest, the least pretentious, the most subtle and amusing in aphoristic skepticism, the deepest in the spirit's labyrinths, the freshest in voice, and the plainest in clear, landscape vision.

The poet read and loved philosophy.  But he iterated many times that logic doesn't sing.  Machado sings in all his poems.
