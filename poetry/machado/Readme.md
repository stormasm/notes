Traveler there is no Road


Traveler, your footprints

are the only road, nothing else.

Traveler, there is no road;

you make your own path as you walk.

As you walk, you make your own road,

and when you look back

you see the path

you will never travel again.

Traveler, there is no road;

only a ship's wake on the sea.


The Water Wheel


The afternoon was falling

sad and dusty.


The water sang

its plebian tune

in the buckets

of the slow water wheel.


The mule dreamed

A poor wasted mule

his metrical shadow

drumming the water.


The afternoon was falling

sad and dusty.


I don't know what noble

godlike poet

strapped the horror

of the eternal wheel


to a bottom harmony

of dreaming water

and blindfolded your eyes

poor wasted mule !


But I know it was a noble

godlike poet

whose heart aged

on black science.


Written by Antonio Machado
