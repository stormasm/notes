## Favorite Poems

### Traveler there is no Road

Traveler, your footprints  
are the only road, nothing else.  
Traveler, there is no road;  
you make your own path as you walk.  
As you walk, you make your own road,  
and when you look back  
you see the path  
you will never travel again.

Traveler, there is no road;  
only a ship's wake on the sea.


### The Water Wheel

The afternoon was falling  
sad and dusty.  
The water sang  
its plebian tune  
in the buckets  
of the slow water wheel.  

The mule dreamed  
A poor wasted mule  
his metrical shadow  
drumming the water.  

The afternoon was falling  
sad and dusty.  


I don't know what noble  
godlike poet  
strapped the horror  
of the eternal wheel  
to a bottom harmony  
of dreaming water  
and blindfolded your eyes  
poor wasted mule !  

But I know it was a noble  
godlike poet  
whose heart aged  
on black science.
