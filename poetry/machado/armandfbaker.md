### The House I loved so much   
La Casa Tan Querida   

La casa tan querida   
donde habitaba ella,   
sobre un montón de escombros   
arruinada o derruida, enseña  
el negro y carcomido  
mal trabado esqueleto de madera.  

La luna está vertiendo  
su clara luz en sueños que platea  
en las vantanas.  
Mal vestido y triste,  
voy caminando por la calle vieja.

Translated by Baker

The much beloved house  
where she used to live,  
ruined or demolished,  
on a mountain of refuse, revealing  
the black and worm-eaten,  
rickety skeleton of wood.  
The moon is pouring out  
its bright light that makes silver  
dreams on the windows. Shabby and sad,  
I go on walking down the old street.  

Translated by Barnstone

The house I loved so much  
where she had lived  
now, over a mound of broken walls and floors  
and flattened debris, is just  
a black termite eaten  
collapsing skeleton of wood.  

The moon is pouring down  
her pristine light in dreams that plate  
the windows silver.  Shabby and sad  
I go walking along the old street.  



#### I Have Walked Down Many Roads
Translated by Don Share

I have walked down many roads  
and cleared many paths;  
I have navigated a hundred oceans  
and anchored off a hundred shores.  

All over, I have seen  
caravans of sadness,  
pompous and melancholy men  
drunk with black shadows,  

and defrocked pedants  
who stare, keep quiet, and think  
they know, because they don’t  
drink wine in the neighborhood bars.

Bad people who go around  
polluting the earth   

And all over, I have seen  
people who dance or play,  
when they can, and work  
their four handfuls of land.  

If they turn up someplace,  
they never ask where they are.  

When they travel, they ride  
on the backs of old mules,  

and don’t know how to hurry,  
not even on holidays.  

When there’s wine, they drink wine;  
when there’s no wine, they drink cool water.  

These are good people, who live,  
work, get by, and dream;  
and on a day like all the others  
they lie down under the earth.”
