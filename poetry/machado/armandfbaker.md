La Casa Tan Querida
The House I loved so much

La casa tan querida
donde habitaba ella,
sobre un mont칩n de escombros
arruinada o derruida, ense침a
el negro y carcomido
mal trabado esqueleto de madera.

La luna est치 vertiendo
su clara luz en sue침os que platea
en las vantanas.
Mal vestido y triste,
voy caminando por la calle vieja.

Translated by Baker

The much beloved house
where she used to live,
ruined or demolished,
on a mountain of refuse, revealing
the black and worm-eaten,
rickety skeleton of wood.
The moon is pouring out
its bright light that makes silver
dreams on the windows. Shabby and sad,
I go on walking down the old street.

Translated by Barnstone

The house I loved so much
where she had lived
now, over a mound of broken walls and floors
and flattened debris, is just
a black termite eaten
collapsing skeleton of wood.

The moon is pouring down
her pristine light in dreams that plate
the windows silver.  Shabby and sad
I go walking along the old street.
