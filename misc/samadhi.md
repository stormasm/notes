samadhi is an ancient sanskrit word for which there is no modern equivalent

there is a fundamental challenge with making a film about samadhi

samadhi points to something that can not be conveyed on the level of mind

this film is simply the outer manifestation of my own inner journey   
the intention is not to teach you about samadhi   
or provide information for your mind   
but to inspire you to directly discover your own true nature   

samadhi is relevant now more than ever   
we are at a time in history   
where we have not only forgotten samadhi   

we have forgotten what we forgot   
this forgetting is maya the illusion of the self.
