### Thomas Pynchon Notes from Sharon Hawley

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sERtP1W4kY  this is long but very interesting,” says Michael.  It’s about “Gravity’s Rainbow”—1960’s, by one of Pynchon’s fans.  Gravity—stones falling like rain ->  rainbow.  Enjoyment diminishes as you see more of something—not true says Pynchon   Multilayered.  It lacks structure.  Weird fantasies.  4 sections in the book.  Teaches a new way to read.  How to hear a novel.  The book is about (not the plot) but the end of WWII and the V-2 German rockets—an instrument of divine will—no.  Gets into the mind of Germans and the Holocaust.  Hitler’s mania.  What does the V-2 rocket symbolize?  Meticulous research by Pynchon.  Understanding culture.  The hero is on a quest on V-2’s.  Lots of criticism on the book.  Networks of details.  Politics and morality.  Dismemberment—things wind blown and fragment.  Skeptical of being included in the culture.  Instrumentality of the media.  Uncertainty principle applied to politics.  The art of excess—art that takes risks.  Forces of power, rather that individuals.  Go to Pynchon for a human response, not for science.  It is a movie/book with allusions to truths.  No distinction between illusion and reality.  Form, rather than experience.  Deliberate ambiguity.  The workings of history.  Focus on the journey.  Germany is not the only author of genocide.   A presence buried in the past.   Life’s endless war against the sdlf  you cannot life without.

Michael, you said this is long, and it is.  But the guy is so fascinated with Pynchon, the male view, and I do love the views of males.  It reminds me of John—another story.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dtqt0bXb4Y more academic stuff,  Michael says.  fiction.  She talks about Pynchon in a way I sort of understand, but not as I better understand a male view.  The threat of mortality.  Language as a mediating force.  A female view of male.  ( I get it, but lose interest.)  Why see men they way women do?   Let her go, she’s on a rant.  I can easily do that.  What I want is a man’s view of man.  A man’s view of woman.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL4_AZe7QH0 some bio info., says Michael.  expert in science.  Paranoia is a theme.  He is not interesting.  He might be gay.  I like gay men.  We both like men.  Trouble is, I like to be liked.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVxBjgMzHes this is crazy stuff... go to around 20 minutes (for example)... talks about southern California,. Says Michel.  Here . again, is a msm talking.  Wonderful.  Who cares.  You, maybe.  If he cannot introduce me into his narrative, then great,  He brings men, wonderful.  Again, I like men. 

Michael says:  you might be interested... Thomas Pynchon and yourself probably have similar memories and experiences of Ca (around the same time)...

very impressive cast of characters he is in company with, Michael says—maybe so.



Pynchon's work has been cited as an influence and inspiration by many writers, including David Foster Wallace, William Vollmann, Richard Powers, Steve Erickson, David Mitchell, Neal Stephenson, Dave Eggers, William Gibson, Salman Rushdie, Alan Moore, and Tommaso Pincio (whose pseudonym is an Italian rendering of Pynchon's name)



Thanks to his influence on Gibson and Stephenson in particular, Pynchon became one of the progenitors of cyberpunk fiction; a 1987 essay in Spin magazine by Timothy Leary explicitly named Gravity's Rainbow as the "Old Testament" of cyberpunk, with Gibson's Neuromancer and its sequels as the "New Testament". Though the term "cyberpunk" did not become prevalent until the early 1980s, since Leary's article many readers have retroactively included Gravity's Rainbow in the genre, along with other works—e.g., Samuel R. Delany's Dhalgren and many works of Philip K. Dick—which seem, after the fact, to anticipate cyberpunk styles and themes. The encyclopedic nature of Pynchon's novels also led to some attempts to link his work with the short-lived hypertext fiction movement of the 1990s.[111]

I find this section about Pynchon especially telling, michael says:

Yes, very impressive!

Precursors: Pynchon's novels refer overtly to writers as disparate as Henry Adams (in V., p. 62), Jorge Luis Borges (in Gravity’s Rainbow, p. 264), Deleuze and Guattari (in Vineland, p. 97),[69] Emily Dickinson (in Gravity’s Rainbow, pp. 27–8), Umberto Eco (in Mason & Dixon, p. 559),[70] Ralph Waldo Emerson (in Vineland, p. 369), "Hopkins, T. S. Eliot, di Chirico’s novel Hebdomeros" (in V., p. 307), William March[citation needed], Vladimir Nabokov (in The Crying of Lot 49, p. 120), Patrick O'Brian (in Mason & Dixon, p. 54), Ishmael Reed (in Gravity’s Rainbow, p. 558), Rainer Maria Rilke (in Gravity’s Rainbow, p. 97 f) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (in V., p. 278 f), and to a heady mixture of iconic religious and philosophical sources.



Critics have made comparisons of Pynchon's writing with works by Rabelais, Cervantes, Laurence Sterne, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Mann, William S. Burroughs, Ralph Ellison,[92][93] Patrick White, and Toni Morrison.



Pynchon's work also has similarities with writers in the modernist tradition who wrote long novels dealing with large metaphysical or political issues, such as Ulysses by James Joyce, A Passage to India by E. M. Forster, The Apes of God by Wyndham Lewis, The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil and the U.S.A. trilogy by John Dos Passos.  Pynchon explicitly acknowledges his debt to Beat Generation writers, and expresses his admiration for Jack Kerouac's On the Road in particular. He also outlines the specific influence on his own early fiction of literary works by T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, Saul Bellow, Herbert Gold, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, John Buchan and Graham Greene, and non-fiction works by Helen Waddell, Norbert Wiener and Isaac Asimov.

I find this section about Pynchon especially telling...

Relatively little is known about Pynchon's private life; he has carefully avoided contact with reporters for more than fifty years. Only a few photos of him are known to exist, nearly all from his high school and college days, and his whereabouts have often remained undisclosed.

A 1963 review of V. in The New York Times Book Review described Pynchon as "a recluse" living in Mexico, thereby introducing the media label with which journalists have characterized him throughout his career.[113] Nonetheless, Pynchon's personal absence from mass media is one of the notable features of his life, and it has generated many rumors and apocryphal anecdotes.

Michael, I, too, am a recluse. Few men know me.  It’s one of the notable features of my life.  He slid inside me then, it was wonderful, and only now can I coherently talk of it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon#Influence  I find this section about Pynchon especially telling..., says Michael.  “In 1990, Pynchon married his literary agent, Melanie Jackson”  It seems to me that he might have gained some insight from her breasts and later in the evening from her vagina.  I know John did. He’d release the bra closure and then draw down the silk panties.  What followed might be of literary importance.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVxBjgMzHes  this is crazy stuff...  go to around 20 minutes (for example)... talks about southern California (Michael says) 

This guy reads unintelligible non-sexual, and therefore, not interesting gibberish.

Bleeding Edge takes place in Manhattan's Silicon Alley during "the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11." The novel was published on September 17, 2013,[60] to positive reviews.
