### Quotes from the Book

Part One Ballyutogue   
Chapter 8   

We live, Dado said, with a number of rooms inside us.  The best room is open to the family and friends and we show our finest face in it.  Another room is more private, the bedroom, and a very few are allowed in.  There is another room where we allow no one in... not even our wives and children, for it is a room of the most intimate thoughts we keep unshared.  There is one more room, so hidden away that we don't even enter it ourselves.  Within we lock all of the mysteries we cannot solve and all the pains and sorrows we wish to forget.
When Kilty died, it unlocked the last of these rooms inside Tomas Larkin and all the bitterness escaped.
