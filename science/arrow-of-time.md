“I’ve found our instincts of time and causation are our deepest, strongest instincts that physicists and philosophers—and humans—are loath to give up,” he added.

If you see an idea pop up enough
which I have
and you really start to think
hard about it
it actually starts to make some sense

it's these crazy ideas
the ones that at first you say this is BS
that are the hardest ones to actually believe

but imagine if all you ever hear is that the earth
is round and then as a young child you see
the round earth then you go "of course"

well imagine if there were visualizations of
this concept ----
well there are
and they live at the "quantum scale"

but then when you start to think about
things you know well in your life

and you say "you know" this concept
could actually work

then you go "holy sh-t"

I think I am starting to get there
in my most recent thought experiments

this is also related possibly to the metaphor of
"this is all just a computer simulation"
