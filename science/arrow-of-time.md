## Note 1 on this topic

If you see an idea pop up enough
which I have
and you really start to think
hard about it
it actually starts to make some sense

it's these crazy ideas
the ones that at first you say this is BS
that are the hardest ones to actually believe

but imagine if all you ever hear is that the earth
is round and then as a young child you see
the round earth then you go "of course"

well imagine if there were visualizations of
this concept ----
well there are
and they live at the "quantum scale"

but then when you start to think about
things you know well in your life

and you say "you know" this concept
could actually work

then you go "holy sh-t"

I think I am starting to get there
in my most recent thought experiments

this is also related possibly to the metaphor of
"this is all just a computer simulation"

## Note 2 on this topic

The summary of the article is that the "future influences the past"

Think of it this way...

You have a direction you are heading off in the future, whatever it may be...

Because you are trying to get somewhere, what you do in the past are the events that you create to get to the future...

Think of a weather system, in the future we know something is going to happen, so you prepare in the past to be ready for it...

The stock market, you think a company has a good idea so you see into the future of what that company can become and therefore you invest today.

Now expand that idea to much greater proportions and magnifications.

But it all boils down to...

Break out of the MOLD that time is linear, always moving forward...

Everything is a continuum of time and space...  That is a cliche but in this context and the descriptions above it makes more sense.

Just change / twist your model in your brain to just slightly start training on a new concept.

And then as your life unfolds you will see it more...

And then you will understand better....

Let me know if this helps at all...

Give yourself some time over the next number of weeks and months, think about the idea, and then let me know if you think it is

kind of / sort of / is more understandable....
